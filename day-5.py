# day 5 of learning python

# today we learned about list in pyhton in other laguage we may call it as array

# we intialize a list by puting items inside []

sample = ["this is ", "sample","of list"]

# we can simply call it to print all the items
print(sample);

# there are some methods for list in python
# some methods like: pop,insert,append
sample.append("Created")
print(sample)

sample.insert(3,"in python")
print(sample)

sample.pop()
print(sample)
