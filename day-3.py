#  we are going to learn about some topic like boolean and or not

a1 = 7>2

print(a1)

#  now we will see some program about AND OR NOT 

a2 = (7>5) and (5>7)

print(a2)
# we'll get our output as false cause in AND conditons both the conditions need to be true if any one of them is false then output will be false

#  now we'll look for OR operator 
 
a3 = (10>9) or (20>100)

#  according to me the output will be true because there one condition need to be true 

print(a3)
# the output is true in OR case if both the condtion is false then the output will be false otherwise the output will be true

# now we'll look at NOT operator 

a4= (7>3)
# the above condition is true 

a5 =not a4

print(a5)
# the above condition will change the output to its opposite for example true will be false and false will be true
