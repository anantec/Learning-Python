# first day of learning PYTHON

# it is simple to print anything in this language like the example given below 

print("Hello! This is my day 1 of learning PYTHON from scratch");

# defining variable in python is easy as compare to other language

Str1 = "This is a variable";

# concatination of two varriables and strings

name = "Anant Singh Dugtal";

Plan_of_action = "Learning PYTHON from free resources";

print ("I am " + name + '\n' + "And I am " + Plan_of_action);

# concatination of non similar variables is not possible in python without converting then into the same data type

age = 19;

# print("I am " + name + "I am" + age +"years old");

# the above code will threw a Type Error as we are trying to concatinate string and integer together 
print("I am " + name + '\n' +"I am " + str(age) +" years old");
